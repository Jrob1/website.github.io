<h1> Hello there <h1>
<h2> About me <h2> 
<p> Full time Consultant; part time techy; dabbler in UI /UX; newbie Vlogger and thought I'd add CSS to my skillset</p> 

<h2> About my project <h2>
<p> Motivation comes from the oddest situtations and mine came between bites of soggy chicken kebab in 'Business Corner' in Lviv writing jira tickets at 2am. 
<br>As I wrote please change 'save' to 'create' for consistenty and 'there needs to be 16px between the heading and body text?' I decided my first ever busiess objective <b>'to never ask a dev to change copy or colours again'</b></p>
